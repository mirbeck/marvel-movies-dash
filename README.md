# marvel-movies-dash

Who doesn't love Marvel movies, right? They have captured the hearts of people all over the world, with their captivating storylines, dynamic characters, and of course, epic battle scenes. This is the dashboard I've created using Python's Dash library. You can filter the data and compare things like the critic score and % budget recovered, the size of the bubble indicates box office performance - a bigger bubble means more money.
